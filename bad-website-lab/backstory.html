                    <h3>Arrival at the Monastary</h3>
                    <p>
                         Mysophinies was born in a goblin camp, which was raided
                         before he ever knew his parents. A raiding party of
                         adventures came to defeat and raze the goblin camp. One
                         of the party members couldnt bring himself to kill the
                         baby mysophinies, and knew that leaving him alone in an
                         empty camp would be the same as doing it with his
                         sword. He brought the baby goblin to a nearby monastary
                         of Necros and left him on the doorstep. Mysophines was
                         raised by the monks outside of goblin culture or
                         ideals.
