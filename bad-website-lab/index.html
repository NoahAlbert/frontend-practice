               <p>Mysophinies is a warrior monk of the temple of Necros.</p>
               <p>
                    As a warrior monk, he has mastered his own internal energy
                    called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi">ki</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
                    He manipulates his
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi">ki</a> and the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi">ki</a> of others
                    to defend his monastary.
               </p>
               <p>
                    As a member of the Way of the Long Death and follower of
                    Necros, Mysophinies views death as a natural and essential
                    process in the cycle of life.
